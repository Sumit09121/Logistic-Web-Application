## Problem Statement

CI/CD for Python Logistics App

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a professional
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a
python Logistics application using modern DevOps tools.

The workflow automates the entire software delivery lifecycle, including
automated unit testing upon every commit and containerized artifact
creation upon merging to the production branch.

This setup ensures high code quality, early detection of defects, and
rapid, reliable deployment cycles suitable for an enterprise
environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description

Design and implement a professional CI/CD pipeline for a Python
Logistics application using GitHub Actions or Jenkins. The pipeline
automates:

-   Automated unit testing on every commit\
-   Continuous integration validation\
-   Containerized artifact creation\
-   Deployment-ready build generation\
-   Reliable production branch workflows

This automation significantly improves development efficiency, reduces
manual intervention, and enforces consistent deployment practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objectives

-   Implement automated CI/CD workflows\
-   Ensure code quality through automated testing\
-   Enable containerized build artifacts using Docker\
-   Support scalable deployment using Kubernetes\
-   Reduce manual deployment errors\
-   Establish reliable production delivery pipelines

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tools & Technologies

-   Version Control: Git\
-   Containerization: Docker\
-   CI/CD: Jenkins / GitHub Actions\
-   Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s)\
-   Programming Language: Python

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Features

-   Automated unit testing on every commit\
-   Continuous integration pipeline\
-   Docker-based artifact generation\
-   Production branch automation\
-   Kubernetes-ready deployment workflow\
-   Improved reliability and deployment speed
